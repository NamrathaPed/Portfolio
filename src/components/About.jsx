        description="Hi, Im Namratha, a recent Masters graduate in Information Systems from DePaul University with a GPA of 3.8/4.0. Iâ€™m passionate about data, AI, and problem-solving, and I enjoy building intelligent systems that make technology more practical and human-centered.

        Ive worked on projects ranging from an AI-powered resume analyzer and AI code debugger to an e-commerce fraud detection system and an image search and recognition tool. Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into Generative AI, LLMs, and agentic AI systems while also strengthening my foundations in data analysis, C++, SQL, and software engineering.

        My skillset spans Python, Java, R, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and cloud computing, along with hands-on experience in Agile/Scrum environments. Beyond technical skills, I bring strong problem-solving, adaptability, and communicationâ€”qualities I continue to refine while applying to both data analyst and software engineer roles."
